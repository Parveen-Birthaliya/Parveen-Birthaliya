##  Career Objective

To secure a role in **Security Engineering** or **Detection & Response**, where I can:

- Engineer and scale SOC pipelines (SIEM, EDR, SOAR)
- Detect, respond, and contain threats in hybrid cloud environments
- Build ML-driven detection models for proactive threat hunting
- Convert threat intel into automated response strategies
